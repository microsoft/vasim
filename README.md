VASIM (**V**ertical **A**utoscaling **SIM**ulator) is a tool designed to address the complexities involved in assessing autoscaling algorithms.

VASIM is designed for testing recommendation algorithms, with a particular focus on CPU usage in VMs and Kubernetes pods. The toolkit
replicates common components found in autoscaler architectures, including the controller, metrics collector, recommender, and
resource updater. It enables a comprehensive simulation of the entire autoscaling system’s behavior, with the flexibility to customize
various parameters.

## Getting started

Our documentation and working example is in our [notebook](examples/using_vasim.ipynb) that shows how to get started simulating your data traces and tuning parameters.  Our example provides the 3 things needed to run VASim: (1) a data csv file, (2) an autoscaling algorithm, and (3) a metadata.json file of parameters. Details of all of these can be found in the notebook.

Addtionally:

* Within each folder, there is a README explaining the code.
  * [simulator](simulator/README.md)
  * [recommender](recommender/README.md)
  * [forecasting](recommender/forecasting/README.md)
  * [cluster state](recommender/cluster_state_provider/README.md)
  * [tests](tests/README.md)

* For additional usage examples, see any test in the [tests](tests) folder that starts with `test_e2e`.

* Please see our [blog post](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/enhanced-autoscaling-with-vasim-vertical-autoscaling-simulator-toolkit/?msockid=0d2280e91b2c6ea41f32935e1a9f6f36) or [research paper](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/vasim-vertical-autoscaling-simulator-toolkit/) for more details!
